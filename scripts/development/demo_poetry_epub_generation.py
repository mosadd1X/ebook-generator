**Awakening**

Beneath the frost's retreating veil,
green shoots pierce the warming earth,
each blade a testament
to hope's enduring strength.

The world exhales winter's hold,
breathing life into barren fields,
while cherry blossoms paint
the sky in shades of pink.

***

**First Light**

Dawn breaks over sleeping gardens,
golden fingers touch the dew,
transforming ordinary moments
into crystalline jewels.

Birds compose their morning songs,
a symphony of new beginnings,
each note a promise
that darkness always yields to light.

***

**Renewal**

In the quiet space between
winter's end and summer's start,
we find ourselves reborn,
shedding old skins like trees shed leaves.

The heart learns to trust again
in cycles older than memory,
in the eternal dance
of death and resurrection.

***

**Growing**

Like seedlings reaching toward the sun,
we stretch beyond our former selves,
roots deepening in rich soil
while branches touch the sky.

Each day brings new possibilities,
each breath a chance to bloom,
to become what we were always
meant to be.

**Abundance**

The earth overflows with plenty,
gardens heavy with fruit,
while children chase fireflies
through fields of golden wheat.

Time moves like honey
in the heat of afternoon,
each moment stretched and savored
like wine aged to perfection.

***

**Thunder Song**

Storm clouds gather on the horizon,
pregnant with electric possibility,
while lightning writes its name
across the darkening sky.

Rain falls in silver sheets,
washing the world clean,
leaving behind the scent
of earth and growing things.

***

**Midnight Garden**

Under stars that pierce the velvet night,
flowers open their secret faces,
releasing perfumes meant
for lovers and dreamers.

The moon casts silver shadows
on paths we've walked before,
transforming familiar landscapes
into realms of magic.

***

**Harvest Moon**

Full and golden, she rises
above the ripening fields,
blessing the work of patient hands
with her ancient light.

We gather what we've sown,
grateful for the earth's gifts,
knowing that abundance shared
multiplies beyond measure.

**Letting Go**

Leaves release their hold
with graceful resignation,
teaching us the art
of beautiful surrender.

What once was green and growing
transforms to gold and crimson,
proving that endings too
can be magnificent.

***

**Harvest Time**

We gather more than grain
in these shortening days‚Äî
memories like pressed flowers,
wisdom earned through seasons lived.

The barn fills with abundance,
the heart with gratitude,
as we prepare for winter's
quiet contemplation.

***

**Migration**

Geese write their stories
across the autumn sky,
following ancient maps
written in their bones.

We too feel the pull
of distant destinations,
the call to journey inward
as the world grows still.

***

**Preparation**

In the gathering dusk,
we stack wood for winter fires,
preserve the summer's sweetness
in jars lined on the shelf.

The earth prepares for sleep,
pulling her blanket close,
while we learn to find warmth
in the light within.

**Stillness**

Snow falls in perfect silence,
covering the world in white,
erasing all the boundaries
between earth and sky.

In this crystalline cathedral,
we learn the sacred art
of being rather than doing,
of listening rather than speaking.

***

**Inner Fire**

When the world grows cold and dark,
we kindle flames within,
feeding them with memories
of summer's golden days.

The heart becomes a hearth
where love burns bright and warm,
sustaining us through winter's
longest, darkest nights.

***

**Solstice**

At the year's turning point,
when darkness claims its throne,
we light candles against the night
and remember light's return.

In the deepest winter
lives the promise of spring,
in the heart of darkness
dwells the seed of dawn.

***

**Circle Complete**

The wheel turns full around,
bringing us back to where we started,
but we are not the same‚Äî
we are deepened, seasoned, wise.

Each season leaves its mark,
each cycle teaches truth:
that life is not a line
but an eternal, sacred spiral.
