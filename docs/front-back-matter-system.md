## Usage

### Basic Novel Generation

The system integrates automatically with the main generation process:

```python
# Writer profile selection is now part of the main generation flow
python -m src.main
```

During generation, users can:
1. Choose an existing writer profile
2. Create a new profile
3. Save generated profiles for future use

### EPUB Generation with Front/Back Matter

```python
from src.formatters.epub_formatter import EpubFormatter

# Create formatter with front/back matter enabled (default)
formatter = EpubFormatter(
    novel_data, 
    writer_profile=writer_profile,
    include_front_matter=True,  # Default: True
    include_back_matter=True    # Default: True
)

# Generate EPUB with all sections
epub_path = formatter.save_epub(output_dir, cover_path, writer_profile)
```

### Writer Profile Management

```python
from src.utils.writer_profile_manager import WriterProfileManager

manager = WriterProfileManager()

# Create a new profile
profile_id = manager.create_profile(
    name="Sci-Fi Visionary",
    genre="Science Fiction",
    profile_data={
        "writing_style": "Hard science fiction with philosophical depth",
        "literary_influences": "Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick",
        "thematic_focuses": "AI consciousness, technological singularity",
        "narrative_techniques": "Multiple perspectives, scientific exposition",
        "strengths": "Complex world-building, realistic technology"
    },
    description="Specialized in hard SF with AI themes"
)

# List available profiles
profiles = manager.list_profiles(genre="Science Fiction")

# Load a profile
profile = manager.load_profile(profile_id)
```
