- **Detailed troubleshooting guidance** in error messages
- **Interactive network diagnostics** with recommendations
- **Live monitoring capabilities** with refresh rates

### ✅ 6. Connection Recovery
- **Automatic detection** of connection restoration
- **Immediate queue processing** when connectivity returns
- **Circuit breaker pattern** with three states (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
- **Smart recovery testing** before resuming normal operations

- **Circuit breaker state**: Current protection status

## 🎮 How to Use

### Automatic Operation
The system works automatically in the background. When you:
1. Generate content normally
2. Experience network issues
3. The system automatically retries with enhanced feedback

### Manual Monitoring
Access network tools through the main menu:
1. Run `python run.py`
2. Select "7. Network Status & Diagnostics"
3. Choose from monitoring options:
   - Quick status overview
   - Detailed status with metrics
   - Connection history
   - Live monitoring (60s)
   - Network diagnostics
   - Force connectivity check

### Testing and Verification
