## Installation

### Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your environment:

```bash
pip install requests==2.31.0 psutil==5.9.8
```

These are automatically included in the updated `requirements.txt`.

### Setup

The network resilience system is automatically initialized when you:
1. Import any component that uses network functionality
2. Run the main application (`python run.py`)
3. Access the "Network Status & Diagnostics" menu

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The network resilience system works automatically in the background. When you generate content:

```python
# The system automatically handles network issues
from src.core.resilient_gemini_client import ResilientGeminiClient

client = ResilientGeminiClient()
result = client.generate_content("Your prompt here")
```

### Network Status Monitoring

Access network monitoring through the main menu:

1. Run `python run.py`
2. Select "7. Network Status & Diagnostics"
3. Choose from various monitoring options:
   - Quick status overview
   - Detailed status with metrics
   - Connection history
   - Live monitoring
   - Network diagnostics

### Manual Network Management

```python
from src.utils.network_resilience import get_network_manager

# Get the global network manager
network_manager = get_network_manager()

# Force a connectivity check
is_connected = network_manager.force_connectivity_check()

# Get detailed status
status = network_manager.get_status()

# Show status panel
network_manager.show_status_panel()
```

## Configuration

### Network Resilience Configuration

```python
config = {
    'status_check_interval': 30,  # seconds between connectivity checks
    'show_status_messages': True,  # show network status changes
    'show_retry_messages': True,   # show retry attempts
    'circuit_breaker': {
        'failure_threshold': 5,    # failures before opening circuit
        'recovery_timeout': 60,    # seconds before testing recovery
        'success_threshold': 3     # successes needed to close circuit
    }
}

from src.utils.network_resilience import NetworkResilienceManager
manager = NetworkResilienceManager(config)
```

### Resilient Client Configuration

```python
from src.core.resilient_gemini_client import ResilientGeminiClient
from src.utils.network_resilience import RequestPriority

client = ResilientGeminiClient()

# Generate content with custom settings
result = client.generate_content(
    prompt="Your prompt",
    priority=RequestPriority.HIGH,
    max_retries=10,
    timeout=180.0,
    use_cache=True
)
```

## Network Status Indicators

### Connection Status
- üü¢ **CONNECTED**: Stable network connection
- üî¥ **DISCONNECTED**: No network connectivity
- üü° **UNSTABLE**: Intermittent connectivity issues
- üîµ **CHECKING**: Currently testing connectivity

### Circuit Breaker Status
- ‚úÖ **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests proceeding
- üö´ **OPEN**: Failing fast to protect system
- üîÑ **HALF-OPEN**: Testing if service has recovered

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Network Status system not available"
- Install required dependencies: `pip install requests psutil`
- Check that all network resilience files are present
- Verify Python environment is properly configured

#### High failure rates
- Check internet connection stability
- Verify API keys are correct and not rate-limited
- Consider adjusting retry settings for slower connections

#### Circuit breaker frequently opening
- Network may be very unstable
- Adjust failure threshold in configuration
- Check for background network usage

### Network Diagnostics

Use the built-in diagnostics tool:
1. Access "Network Status & Diagnostics" from main menu
2. Select "Run Network Diagnostics"
3. Review results and follow recommendations

### Manual Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_network_resilience.py
```

## Performance Impact

The network resilience system is designed to be lightweight:

- **Background monitoring**: ~1% CPU usage
- **Memory overhead**: ~10-20MB for queuing and metrics
- **Network overhead**: Minimal connectivity checks every 30 seconds
- **Response time**: No impact on successful requests

## Best Practices

### For Unstable Connections
1. Enable response caching for frequently used prompts
2. Use higher priority for critical requests
3. Increase timeout values for slow connections
4. Monitor network status regularly

### For Development
1. Use the test script to verify functionality
2. Monitor network metrics during development
3. Test with simulated network issues
4. Configure appropriate retry limits

### For Production
1. Set conservative circuit breaker thresholds
2. Enable comprehensive logging
3. Monitor network health metrics
4. Have fallback procedures for extended outages

## Integration with Existing Code

The network resilience system integrates seamlessly with existing code:

### Automatic Integration
- All existing Gemini API calls automatically benefit from enhanced retry logic
- Network status is checked before major operations
- Error messages include troubleshooting guidance

### Manual Integration
Replace direct GeminiClient usage with ResilientGeminiClient for maximum benefits:

```python
# Before
from src.core.gemini_client import GeminiClient
client = GeminiClient()

# After
from src.core.resilient_gemini_client import ResilientGeminiClient
client = ResilientGeminiClient()
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Available Metrics
- Total requests processed
- Success/failure rates
- Average response times
- Consecutive failure/success counts
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Connection history

### Accessing Metrics
```python
from src.utils.network_resilience import get_network_manager

manager = get_network_manager()
status = manager.get_status()

print(f"Success rate: {status['metrics']['success_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Average response time: {status['metrics']['average_response_time']:.2f}s")
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Adaptive retry strategies based on error types
- Machine learning for connection prediction
- Integration with system network events
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance optimization for mobile networks
