# Genre-Specific Recommendations

This directory is intended for storing genre-specific writer profile recommendations.

## Purpose
- **Planned Feature**: Store genre-specific profile modules
- Referenced in `writer_profile_manager.py` but not implemented
- Intended for advanced genre-based profile selection

## File Format
Would store Python modules with genre-specific profile variants:
`{genre_key}.py` (e.g., `science_fiction.py`, `mystery.py`)

## Usage
- Currently referenced in `get_profile_by_style()` method
- Attempts to import from this directory fail gracefully
- Future feature for style-based profile variants (Master, Innovator, etc.)

## Status
**Empty - Planned Feature**: This directory exists for future functionality but is not currently implemented.
