Mock Components for Fast Testing

This module provides mock implementations of time-consuming components
to enable ultra-fast testing while maintaining the same code paths
as the production system.

Key Features:
- Mock Gemini API client with instant responses
- Configurable response patterns for different test scenarios
- Maintains same interface as real components
- Provides realistic but minimal content for testing

        "Maybe it's time for a break," Sarah suggested. "Fresh air might help."

        when you stopped looking for them.

        The morning sun filtered through the office windows as Alex stared at the computer screen. 
        The code wasn't working, and the deadline was approaching fast. Three weeks of development 
        had led to this moment, and everything seemed to be falling apart.
        
        "Another coffee?" Sarah asked, appearing at the cubicle entrance with two steaming mugs.
        
        "Thanks, but I think I've had enough caffeine for one lifetime," Alex replied, rubbing tired eyes. 
        The monitor's blue glow had become a constant companion over the past few days.
        
        The project had seemed simple enough at the startâ€”a basic inventory management system 
        for a local bookstore. But complications kept arising like weeds in a garden. 
        Each solution created new problems, like a digital hydra growing new heads.
        
        "What's the issue this time?" Sarah pulled up a chair, her artist's eye scanning 
        the lines of code with surprising understanding.
        
        "The database integration is failing. Every time I fix one query, another breaks." 
        Alex gestured at the screen in frustration. "It's like the system has a mind of its own."
        
        Sarah studied the code for a moment, then pointed to a section near the top. 
        "What about this connection string? Looks like it might be causing conflicts."
        
        Alex leaned forward, following Sarah's finger. She was rightâ€”a small typo in the 
        configuration was cascading through the entire system. Sometimes it took fresh eyes 
        to see what had been hiding in plain sight.
        
        "You're brilliant," Alex said, making the correction. "How did you spot that?"
        
        "Same way I spot composition issues in my paintings. Sometimes you need to step back 
        and look at the whole picture instead of focusing on individual brushstrokes."
        
        The fix worked. The system came alive, data flowing smoothly between components. 
        Alex felt the familiar rush of satisfaction that came with solving a complex problem.
        
        "Lunch?" Sarah suggested. "I think this calls for a celebration."
        
        Alex nodded, saving the work and standing up. Sometimes the best solutions came 
        when you stopped looking for them, and the best friends were the ones who helped 
        you see clearly when everything seemed impossible.

        They walked to the small cafÃ© down the street, the one with mismatched chairs 
        and walls covered in local artwork. Sarah's paintings hung in the corner, 
        vibrant landscapes that seemed to capture more than just scenery.
        
        "I've been thinking," Sarah said as they settled at their usual table by the window. 
        "About what you said last week, about feeling stuck."
        
        Alex looked up from the menu, though they both knew they'd order the same thing 
        they always did. "The job situation?"
        
        "Everything. The job, the city, the routine. You've been talking about change 
        for months, but you never actually do anything about it."
        
        It was true, and Alex knew it. The comfortable routine had become a comfortable prison. 
        Wake up, work, solve problems, go home, repeat. Even the satisfaction of fixing 
        today's bug felt hollow somehow.
        
        "Change is scary," Alex admitted. "What if I make the wrong choice?"
        
        "What if you make the right one?" Sarah countered. "What if staying is the wrong choice?"
        
        The waitress brought their usual orders without being askedâ€”grilled cheese and tomato 
        soup for Alex, quinoa salad for Sarah. The familiarity was comforting and suffocating 
        at the same time.
        
        "I got an email yesterday," Alex said quietly. "From that startup in Portland. 
        They want to interview me for the senior developer position."
        
        Sarah's eyes lit up. "That's amazing! When's the interview?"
        
        "I haven't responded yet." Alex stirred the soup absently. "It would mean leaving 
        everything behind. This job, this city, this life we've built."
        
        "This life you've built," Sarah corrected gently. "I'll still be here when you get back. 
        And if you don't get back, well, Portland's not that far away."
        
        The afternoon passed quickly, filled with planning and possibilities. By the time 
        they returned to the office, Alex had made a decision. The email response was short 
        but decisive: "I'd be honored to interview for the position."
        
        Change was scary, but staying scared was scarier.
