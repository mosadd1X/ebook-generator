## Contemporary Fiction-Specific Writing Considerations
- **Authenticity and Voice**: Develop a distinct and authentic voice that resonates with contemporary readers. Pay close attention to capturing the nuances of modern language and cultural references.
- **Character-Driven Narrative**: Prioritize character development and ensure that the plot is driven by the characters' motivations, desires, and flaws.
- **Social Commentary**: Consider incorporating subtle social commentary on relevant issues without being preachy or didactic. Let the characters and their experiences speak for themselves.
- **Relatable Themes**: Focus on universal themes such as love, loss, identity, and belonging, but explore them through the lens of contemporary experiences.
- **Realistic Dialogue**: Craft dialogue that sounds natural and authentic, reflecting the way people actually speak in the modern world. Avoid clichÃ©s and forced exposition.
- **Setting as Character**: Use the setting to enhance the mood, atmosphere, and thematic resonance of the story. Pay attention to details that ground the story in a specific time and place.
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Embrace moral ambiguity and explore the gray areas of human behavior. Avoid simplistic portrayals of good versus evil.
