## Literary Fiction-Specific Writing Considerations
- **Character-Driven Narrative**: Prioritize the development of complex, believable characters with internal conflicts and motivations. Focus on their psychological depth and emotional journeys.
- **Thematic Resonance**: Identify and explore universal themes that resonate with readers on a deeper level. Use symbolism, metaphor, and imagery to convey these themes effectively.
- **Sophisticated Prose**: Employ elegant and precise language, paying attention to rhythm, tone, and imagery. Avoid clichÃ©s and strive for originality in your writing style.
- **Subtle Plot Development**: Focus on internal conflicts and emotional journeys rather than external action. Allow the plot to unfold organically from the characters' choices and experiences.
- **Realistic Worldbuilding**: Create believable settings that reflect the themes of the story and provide a backdrop for the characters' experiences. Pay attention to detail and authenticity.
- **Exploration of Human Condition**: Delve into the complexities of human relationships, the challenges of existence, and the search for meaning and purpose in a chaotic world.
- **Ambiguity and Open-Endedness**: Embrace ambiguity and leave certain questions unanswered, encouraging readers to engage with the text on a deeper level and draw their own conclusions.
- **Social Commentary (Optional)**: Consider incorporating subtle or overt critiques of societal norms, political systems, and cultural values to prompt readers to reflect on the world around them.

## Literary Fiction-Specific Outline Requirements
- **Character Arcs**: Outline the emotional and psychological journeys of your main characters, focusing on their internal conflicts and transformations.
- **Thematic Development**: Identify the key themes you want to explore and outline how they will be developed throughout the story. Consider using recurring motifs or symbols.
- **Subtle Plot Points**: Focus on key moments of decision and realization for your characters, rather than plot-driven events. These moments should drive the narrative forward and reveal deeper truths about the characters and their world.
- **Setting as Character**: Consider how the setting can be used to reflect the themes of the story and the emotional states of the characters. Outline key settings and their symbolic significance.
- **Internal Conflict**: Emphasize the internal struggles of your characters. Outline the nature of these conflicts and how they will be resolved (or not) by the end of the story.
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Outline the key relationships between characters and how they will evolve throughout the story. Focus on the complexities and nuances of these relationships.
- **Symbolic Structure**: Consider using a symbolic structure to organize your story, such as a journey, a quest, or a descent into darkness.
- **Open-Ended Resolution**: Plan for an ending that is ambiguous or open-ended, leaving readers with questions to ponder and encouraging them to engage with the text on a deeper level.

## Literary Fiction-Specific Character Development
- **Internal Conflicts**: Focus on creating characters with deep-seated internal conflicts that drive their actions and shape their personalities. What are their deepest fears, desires, and insecurities?
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Avoid creating purely good or purely evil characters. Instead, create characters who are morally ambiguous and capable of both good and bad actions.
- **Psychological Depth**: Delve into the psychological complexities of your characters. Explore their past traumas, their coping mechanisms, and their motivations for their actions.
- **Realistic Flaws**: Give your characters realistic flaws that make them relatable and believable. These flaws should be integral to their personalities and should influence their decisions.
- **Character Arcs**: Plan for your characters to undergo significant transformations throughout the story. How will their experiences change them, and what lessons will they learn?
- **Subtlety in Motivation**: Avoid explicitly stating your characters' motivations. Instead, reveal their motivations through their actions, their dialogue, and their interactions with other characters.
- **Backstory Integration**: Develop a detailed backstory for each of your main characters, and integrate this backstory into the narrative in a subtle and organic way.
- **Unreliable Narrators**: Consider using an unreliable narrator to add layers of complexity and ambiguity to your story.

## Literary Fiction-Specific Chapter Writing
- **Focus on Atmosphere**: Prioritize creating a strong sense of atmosphere through vivid descriptions of the setting, the weather, and the characters' emotional states.
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Use sensory details and evocative language to show the reader what is happening, rather than simply telling them.
- **Internal Monologue**: Incorporate internal monologue to reveal the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
- **Subtext and Implication**: Use subtext and implication to convey deeper meaning and create a sense of unease or tension.
- **Symbolic Imagery**: Employ symbolic imagery to reinforce the themes of the story and add layers of meaning to the narrative.
- **Pacing and Rhythm**: Vary the pacing and rhythm of your writing to create a sense of flow and momentum. Use short, choppy sentences to create tension, and long, flowing sentences to create a sense of peace or tranquility.
- **Character-Driven Scenes**: Ensure that each scene is driven by the characters' actions and decisions. Avoid scenes that are purely expositional or plot-driven.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Strive to create scenes that resonate emotionally with the reader, evoking feelings of empathy, sadness, joy, or anger.
